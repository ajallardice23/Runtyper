<p align="left">I Participated in a game jam with the theme of run. 
I decided to create a typing game where the player races against AI by pressing specific keys. 
I used unity to develop the game and designed my own assets in blender.
This was the first game jam I participated in and I managed to achieve a top 15 finish!</p>
